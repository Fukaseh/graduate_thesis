  abstract  = {We report market experiments in which human traders are replaced by "zero-intelligence" programs that submit random bids and offers. Imposing a budget constraint (i.e., not permitting traders to sell below their costs or buy above their values) is sufficient to raise the allocative efficiency of these auctions close to 100 percent. Allocative efficiency of a double auction derives largely from its structure, independent of traders' motivation, intelligence, or learning. Adam Smith's invisible hand may be more powerful than some may have thought; it can generate aggregate rationality not only from individual rationality but also from individual irrationality.},

  abstract = {This paper introduces an agent-based artificial financial market in which heterogeneous agents trade one single asset through a realistic trading mechanism for price formation. Agents are initially endowed with a finite amount of cash and a given finite portfolio of assets. There is no money-creation process; the total available cash is conserved in time. In each period, agents make random buy and sell decisions that are constrained by available resources, subject to clustering, and dependent on the volatility of previous periods. The model proposed herein is able to reproduce the leptokurtic shape of the probability density of log price returns and the clustering of volatility. Implemented using extreme programming and object-oriented technology, the simulator is a flexible computational experimental facility that can find applications in both academic and industrial research projects.}

  abstract  = {Time series of financial asset returns often exhibit the volatility clustering property: large changes in prices tend to cluster together, resulting in persistence of the amplitudes of price changes. After recalling various methods for quantifying and modeling this phenomenon, we discuss several economic mechanisms which have been proposed to explain the origin of this volatility clustering in terms of behavior of market participants and the news arrival process. A common feature of these models seems to be a switching between low and high activity regimes with heavy-tailed durations of regimes. Finally, we discuss a simple agent-based model which links such variations in market activity to threshold behavior of market participants and suggests a link between volatility clustering and investor inertia.},

Our model does not necessarily converge to an equilibrium, and can show bubbles, crashes, and continued high trading volume.}

  abstract = {In a conventional asset market model we study the evolutionary process generated by wealth flows between investors. Asymptotic behavior of our model is completely determined by the investors' expected growth rates of wealth share. Investment rules are more or less “fit” depending upon the value of this expectation, and more fit rules survive in the market at the expense of the less fit. Using this criterion we examine the long run behavior of asset prices and the common belief that the market selects for rational investors. We find that fit rules need not be rational, and rational rules not be fit. Finally, we investigate how the market selects over various adaptive decision rules.}

In equilibrium, the bid and ask prices depend only on the numbers of buy and sell orders in the book. The model has a number of empirical predictions: (i) higher trading activity and higher trading competition cause smaller spreads and lower price impact; (ii) market orders lead to a temporary price impact larger than the permanent price impact, therefore to price overshooting; (iii) buy and sell orders can cluster away from the bid-ask spread, generating a hump-shaped order book; (iv) bid and ask prices display a comovement effect: after, e.g., a sell market order moves the bid price down, the ask price also falls, by a smaller amount, so the bid-ask spread widens; (v) when the order book is full, traders may submit quick, or fleeting, limit orders.},

  abstract  = {Standard models in economics stress the role of intelligent agents who maximize utility. However, there may be situations where constraints imposed by market institutions dominate strategic agent behavior. We use data from the London Stock Exchange to test a simple model in which minimally intelligent agents place orders to trade at random. The model treats the statistical mechanics of order placement, price formation, and the accumulation of revealed supply and demand within the context of the continuous double auction and yields simple laws relating order-arrival rates to statistical properties of the market. We test the validity of these laws in explaining cross-sectional variation for 11 stocks. The model explains 96% of the variance of the gap between the best buying and selling prices (the spread) and 76% of the variance of the price diffusion rate, with only one free parameter. We also study the market impact function, describing the response of quoted prices to the arrival of new orders. The nondimensional coordinates dictated by the model approximately collapse data from different stocks onto a single curve. This work is important from a practical point of view, because it demonstrates the existence of simple laws relating prices to order flows and, in a broader context, suggests there are circumstances where the strategic behavior of agents may be dominated by other considerations.},
